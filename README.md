* Admin can add any number of candidates. Once the election is started, admin cannot add any further candidates.
* Minimum of 2 candidates are required for the election to be started.
* Each voter can vote only once with one address.
* Only admin can view current votes while the election is still on. 
* Once the admin ends the election, results will be made public to all.
